<h3>Bio</h3>

Beginning in August 2018 I joined the
<a href="http://inside.mines.edu/AMS-home"> Department of Applied
Mathematics and Statistics </a> at <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/AMS-home">  Colorado School of Mines
</a>
as a tenured
Full Professor.  As new staff I got a cool yellow hard hat and hiked
up 
to the M along with the incoming freshman.  With this move I will retain an
appointment at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) as
an emeritus scientist and I plan to be at the Mesa Lab on a regular
basis.

At NCAR I served as  Director of the Institute for Mathematics Applied
to Geosciences (November, 2004 - August 2017) (IMAGe)  My main task
was to enrich the scientific and educational activity at NCAR through
mathematical methods and models. Also, I used the large scientific
projects at NCAR to engage the mathematical science communities in new
applications and to motivate new mathematics and statistics. Before
directing IMAGe I was the GSP project leader ( August,1997 - June, 2006).


Some current personal research interests are nonparametric regression
(mostly splines), statistical computing, spatial statistics and
spatial designs. I was a Math/Physics undergrad at Duke, with Robert
Wolpert as my advisor, and received my Ph D ('83) from the University
of Wisconsin under Grace Wahba. Although my original thesis work was
on splines and inverse problems, over time I have become more
interested in spatial statistics and Bayesian methods for curve and
surface fitting. This change of course came about by the chance to
work at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (1994-1996) on
an EPA grant. During this time I wrote the first version of the Krig
function (at about 11PM the night before an EPA presentation) in the S
language. Krig was first part of the funfits package, coauthored with
Perry Haaland and Barb Bailey and it is now in the fields R package --
completely different code but still with the same name. I guess this
is like my career!

I came to GSP/NCAR in 1997 after spending 14 enjoyable years as a
faculty member in the Statistics Department at North Carolina State
University. This was supposed to be an interesting leave of absence
for just two years ... Well, people will not dispute that time moves
differently in Boulder. My primary research interests are spatial
statistics for large data sets and I collaborate with Dorit Hammerling, Soutir Bandyopadhyay, and Will Kleiber. The newest R
package from my work is LatticeKrig a spatial data package that uses
both fields and spam to handle large spatial data sets.  I gave a
series of talks on my past research, climate science and emerging
statistical problems as 
 <a href="https://www.statmos.washington.edu/?p=42"> STATMOS Ten Lectures on statistics and
climate </a>. I also put together a more recent series of 9 (IX)
lectures on curve and function estimation including spatial data analysis
for the University of Fudan in Shanghai (May 2017) see
<a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JJtOVblrvGCDTGLMn4z3g9aBG50gT4Hj">FudanIX</a>.

In coming to Mines I am interested in reconnecting with undergraduate
teaching with a focus on modernizing the curriculum in stats and
making it seamless with the emerging area of data science. See <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bzm0rn5FoGxRSk1CWHp1RlB5VkE?usp=sharing">Data
Science 101</a> for an experimental first course that I put together and
taught at CU Boulder. 




My wife Helen Nychka is a speech language pathologist serving autistic
children and is a founder at Thrive Autism Collaborative. We have three kids: Allie (30), Everett (27) and Grace (24). Some interests outside work are skiing the trees and bumps at Mary Jane, gym climbing, trail running -- and remodeling houses (the one who dies with the most tools wins)!
